    Martin has worked in the mobile device technology field since 1994. Before Martin started working for MSAB in 2004, before that he was working with consumer
    hardware manufacturers as product manager. During these years, Martin was part of Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) and involved in creating the Bluetooth
    standard. He was also part of the team creating and implementing the EXIF standard. In 2004 Martin started working for MSAB as a mobile forensic specialist trainer. Having delivered more than a hundred training courses globally, Martin is well
    recognized in the digital forensic industry. Whilst mobile forensics is his main field of expertise, he has a longstanding awareness of digital and cyber forensics,
    and the challenges encountered in the industry. Martin has held many roles within MSAB over the last 16 years, bouncing back and forth between sales and development, and he is currently working as TechSales manager.
    He also oversees the work being done in Research and Development on the physical extraction and decryption capabilities in XRY, along with more specialized products for
    device penetration. Martin has a long history of leading workshops for government organizations and presenting at forensics conferences and seminars - HTCIA, F3, DC3, Mobile Forensics World,
    Techno Forensics and the Crimes Against Children Conference, to name a few. Martin is also part of the Interpol Digital Forensics Expert Group and has on several occasions, assisted law enforcement and government agencies in successfully acquiring
    mobile data from challenging and complex high-profile cases to support major investigations. Martin is also the only known person to have successfully completed a forensic extraction of a phone whilst in freefall. He once combined skydiving with mobile forensics
    and recorded the moment - to invent a new sport called extreme hexdumping. So far there is only one practitioner.
