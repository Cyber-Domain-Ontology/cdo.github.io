        <h2>Cyber Domain Ontology</h2>
        <p class="mb-0">
          The mission of the Project is to develop and promote the adoption of a
          community developed ecosystem for standardized information
          representation across the cyber domain, based on the Unified Cyber
          Ontology (UCO), including application domain ontologies such as the
          Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE). The Cyber
          Domain Ontology (CDO) is intended to serve the needs of a broad range
          of domains, including cyber-investigation, digital forensics, incident
          response, cyber risk management, supply chain security, threat
          intelligence, and computer/network protection. UCO serves as a
          foundation for modeling cyber domain concepts and elements using a
          standardized representation that is both human-understandable and
          machine-interpretable. The primary motivation for UCO is to establish
          a middle domain ontology that supports information representations for
          related application domain ontology communities, defined as
          context-specific extensions within the consistent overall Cyber Domain
          Ontology ecosystem. Through this approach not only are domain-focused
          representations defined consistently but they also can take advantage
          of shared APIs/tooling and information flow in an automated fashion
          across application domain boundaries. CASE, which aligns with and
          extends UCO, is an evolving standard for representing information
          commonly analyzed and exchanged during investigations involving
          digital evidence. The primary motivation for CASE is to lessen the
          analytic burden of cyber investigators by providing a common language
          to support automated interoperability, normalization, combination and
          validation of varied information sources to facilitate analysis and
          exploration of investigative questions. In addition to advancing the
          efficient and accurate exchange of cyber-investigation information
          between tools and organizations, CASE ensures that analysis results
          can be traced back to their source(s), keeping track of when, where
          and who used which tools to perform investigative actions on data
          sources.
